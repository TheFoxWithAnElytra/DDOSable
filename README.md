# DDOSable

DDOSable is a tool that you can use to attack your site, to check if it could be DDOSed.

This tool is not supposed to be used for malicious activities, or attacks, it is purely meant for testing the securities of your site.
This tool is meant to be used for just Educational/Testing purposes.
I will not, and can not be considered personally liable for any misuse of this software.
All you need to do to use this tool is to download the application(for your operating system), and run it(it will ask you some questions, and tell execute the requests).
Thank You!
